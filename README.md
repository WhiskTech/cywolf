Cywolf
======

Cywolf: evented, modular wolfgame for node.
This module was originally part of [the IRC bot](http://cywolf.co.uk).

## API documentation

I'm not bothered to write much here, so you can just have a look at [bot2.js from the cyril project](https://github.com/whiskers75/cyril/blob/master/bot2.js) to see how this is used in an IRC-type context.
